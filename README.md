### Introduction

This is the official repository for LottieFiles' web renderers for Lottie and dotLottie animations. It contains a set of packages that support developers in integrating and managing animations within web applications.

### What is dotLottie?

dotLottie is an open-source file format that aggregates one or more Lottie files and their associated resources into a single file. They are ZIP archives compressed with the Deflate compression method and carry the file extension of ".lottie".

### Packages

The monorepo contains the following package:

* **[@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web](./packages/web/README.md)**: A JavaScript library for rendering Lottie and dotLottie animations in the browser.

Each package has its own README.md with detailed documentation on usage and development.

### Coming Soon Packages

We are actively working on expanding our suite of packages. Here's what's coming soon:

* **@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react**: A React component wrapper for `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web` that provides a declarative API for rendering Lottie and dotLottie animations and UI controls for interacting with them.

* **@lottiefiles/dotlottie-wc**: A Web Component wrapper for `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web` that provides a declarative API for rendering Lottie and dotLottie animations and UI controls for interacting with them.

Stay tuned for updates and releases of these new packages!
